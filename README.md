Convert QuickBooks to FrontAccounting

I developed a process to extract the data from the IIF file using a series of Perl scripts to split the lists into CSV files. 
These were then fed into a PHP program to load into FA. While this worked, the research, reverse engineering, and development 
took way longer than I would have liked, and then still required significant manual editing.

While this works, I’m providing it ‘As Is’ and while I’m happy to answer questions about it, I’m not really recommending it for 
production use. It might be useful for someone that needs to extract data from IIF files, or loading list data into FA.
